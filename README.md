The primary objective was to design a complete model of a complex network by discovering the interconnectivity of the systems and sub-networks, which will reflect a university named the University of Professional structure and facilities.On top of that, a webpage for University of Professional was to be made and it would be located through the address http://www.universityofprofessional.edu. Each Campus was also given a wireless access point to access the network. All the 6 campuses of the university were encompassed in the complex network along with sub-nets inside each campus.
